# Operation Overlord (D-Day).
June 6th, 1944 or D-Day is perhaps one of the most well known dates. D-Day has been portrayed in popular culture a great deal in mediums such as film (*Saving Private Ryan*) or video games (*Call of Duty: WWII*). While these popular culture mediums may capture the severity of the fight, they often overlook the spacial component of the landings. They often portray the US landing on Omaha Beach. However, there were four other landings that day spread a considerable distance across the Normandy Coastline. There were five beach spread across a massive location as depicted in the google map below.
