# Operation Overlord (D-Day).
June 6th, 1944 or D-Day is perhaps one of the most well known dates. D-Day has been portrayed in popular culture a great deal in mediums such as film (Saving Private Ryan) or video games (Call of Duty: WWII). While these popular culture mediums may capture the severity of the fight, they often fail to capture the actual vast nature fo the entire landings as the distance between beachheads was considerable. Spatial awareness was key to the success of this operation because if any assets were in the wrong place at the wrong time, the whole invasion could have been a failure.

## **Before the Landing**

The five beaches were Gold, Sword, Juno, Omaha and Utah beach. Gold and Sword beach’s were attacked by the British, Juno by the Canadians leaving the Americans with Omaha and Utah beaches. Consider the planning involved with such an operation and the exact detailing allied intelligence had to do when building maps for the raid. In total, 156,000 soldiers were landed on the five beaches which spanned approximately 100km [Richard Foot](http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/normandy-invasion/). Furthermore, British, Canadian and US paratroopers landed behind enemy lines with the specific task of disabling key communication [Ibid](http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/normandy-invasion/). Why is this important? Well, not only did intelligence need to create a detailed map for their own spatial awareness they also needed to transfer this knowledge to the soldiers. “As soldiers waited in their camps, they pored over maps, photographs and three-dimensional models of the invasion beaches, constructed from information meticulously collected over the previous months. The models and pictures showed the layout of the Normandy coastline and important landmarks — houses, church spires, headlands — so that every officer and soldier would know their objectives and what awaited them”[Ibid](http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/normandy-invasion/).

## Paratroopers

If the paratroopers landed off target (which they did on D-Day), they would need to be able to orientate themselves. This was an incredible accomplishment considering that France had been occupied by Germany since 1940 making the only source of detailed maps of the area arial photos or from resistance groups. For example, Sword and Utah beach were both key targets that involved the airborne divisions before the invasion began [Jesse Greenspan](https://www.history.com/news/landing-at-normandy-the-5-beaches-of-d-day). At these locations, paratroopers missed their marks and landings but thanks to proper training and detailed mappings of the area, not only were they able to destroy their key objectives, but they were also able to link up with the invading forces once they landed on the beaches as well and provide support [Ibid](https://www.history.com/news/landing-at-normandy-the-5-beaches-of-d-day). It is noteworthy to consider how the paratroopers and invading forces formed a pincer like movement in two major ways that is actually very intuitive. Firstly, Utah and Sword were the two most extreme easterly and westerly beaches (See the Map) meaning that as they were taken, they could apply pressure to the sectors in the middle forcing the Nazis to have to worry about forces moving across. Second, was the paratroopers being able to link up with the landing forces meant that they attacked from behind the defending Germans while their fellow soldiers attacked from the front. This would have forced the Nazi’s to fight on multiple fronts.

## The Beaches Themselves

There was also the planning of when each set of landing crafts would reach the beaches. On that day the tide produced varying results. For example, British soldiers landed on Sword Beach approximately one hour early which made them the only landing division for the Nazis to focus on over the 100km stretch while at Juno, the Canadians landed an hour late due to rough seas.[Ibid](https://www.history.com/news/landing-at-normandy-the-5-beaches-of-d-day0). Why is this significant to spatial awareness? It is significant because navigating the sea wall is incredibly difficult and despite the tied being an uncontrollable factor, the ability for landing crafts to still maintain for landing locations is important. If these crafts are unable to navigate, they are unable to effectively deliver enough men on the beach to overwhelm the defences.

one can see the pathing that each landing force was to follow and where they were supposed to meet up to establish a beachhead as well as the paratrooper locations that the Allies had so painstakingly planed. Each troop movement was choreographed and marked so that units did not have to worry about where another one was, everyone could move as one single massive force.
