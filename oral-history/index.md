The Vietnam War was one of the bloodiest and most polarizing conflicts of the 20th century. Vietnam was portrayed by the US as a war against communism (which it was) but as Secretary of Defence Robert McNamara noted in the interview above, it was one of aggression.  They (The United States) could not fathom nor understand why nations may choose to be communist they believed that it must have been nothing but force or duress that put them there. McNamara looked back in retrospect on the war and provided a historiographical reasoning as to why America went to war and if in hindsight this was the right decision (which he felt it was not). Begin playing the audio clip.

## Historiographical Context
Before one can understand why in 1964, the US entered Vietnam, the global landscape prior to this must be examined. Consider a brief skeletal timeline of events in the history of the world beginning at the turn of the 20th century: from 1880-1900 there was the colonial **Scramble for Africa** where western Europe spliced up the continent, from 1914-1919 **World War I** was fought, from October 27th 1929 until the outbreak of  the second great war The **Great Depression** destroyed countries with widespread poverty, late from 1939-1945 **World War II** was fought and the *atomic bomb* was created, from 1950-1953 the **Korea War** was fought, in 1956 there was the **Suez Crisis** and finally from 1953-1956 there was the **Cuban Revolution**. Much of these events are the clashing of different ideologies around the world and devoid of political opinion they are objective tragedies. Each of these events regardless of the side of the conflict one was on had the same premise: It was good v. evil, righteous v. injustice. Particularly, there was a strong use of this narrative after WWII. We see the world today as a lush global landscape, but from 1946-1991 the world could be essentially divided in half; democracy and communism (This is an over simplification of history but to avoid an incredibly long paper we will operate with this two main themes).

The struggle for began immediately following WWII in Vietnam itself and in Berlin. It began in Vietnam not with America but with France. Vietnam or as it was called then French Indochina was a colony of the French prior to WWII which they eventually lost to Japan at the end of the war in 1945 as a communist country ^[Miriman 1166]. In 1946, France managed to retake Vietnam by conquering Hanoi. Yet just 8 years later Ho Chi Min and his forces would retake half of Vietnam on 1954 leading it to be divided into two states: North and South Vietnam. North Vietnam was communist under Ho Chi Min and South Vietnam became a republic and a client state of the United States with various leaders, most notably Win Van Tu. In the end, control for Vietnam once again revolved around democracy and communism at least in the eyes of the west as McNamara noted. While these events transpired in Vietnam, America and Russia were fighting for control of Germany as a whole. Stalin focused on increasing the Soviet sphere of influence while Truman and Eisenhower tried to contain it. The US feared a domino effect would take place where some nations of war-torn Europe would seek Soviet economic assistance. Initiatives such as the ERP and Marshall Plan demonstrated the deep seeded desire of US imperil economic control over the world ^[American Textbook].
