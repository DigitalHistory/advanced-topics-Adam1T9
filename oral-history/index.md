## Introduction

The Vietnam War was one of the bloodiest and most polarizing conflicts of the 20th century. Vietnam was portrayed by the US as a war against communism (which it was) but as Secretary of Defence Robert McNamara noted in the interview above, it was one of aggression.  They (The United States) could not fathom nor understand why nations may choose to be communist they believed that it must have been nothing but force or duress that put them there. McNamara looked back in retrospect on the war and provided a historiographical reasoning as to why America went to war and if in hindsight this was the right decision (which he felt it was not).

## Historiographical Context
Before one can understand why in 1964, the US entered Vietnam, the global landscape prior to this must be examined. Consider a brief skeletal timeline of events in the history of the world beginning at the turn of the 20th century: from 1880-1900 there was the colonial **Scramble for Africa** where western Europe spliced up the continent, from 1914-1919 **World War I** was fought, from October 27th 1929 until the outbreak of  the second great war The **Great Depression** destroyed countries with widespread poverty, late from 1939-1945 **World War II** was fought and the *atomic bomb* was created, from 1950-1953 the **Korea War** was fought, in 1956 there was the **Suez Crisis** and finally from 1953-1956 there was the **Cuban Revolution**. Much of these events are the clashing of different ideologies around the world and devoid of political opinion they are objective tragedies. Each of these events regardless of the side of the conflict one was on had the same premise: It was good v. evil, righteous v. injustice. Particularly, there was a strong use of this narrative after WWII. We see the world today as a lush global landscape, but from 1946-1991 the world could be essentially divided in half; democracy and communism (This is an over simplification of history but to avoid an incredibly long paper we will operate with this two main themes).
